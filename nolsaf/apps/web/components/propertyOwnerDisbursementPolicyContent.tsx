          This Disbursement Policy governs how NoLSAF processes and disburses payments to Property Owners for accommodation services rendered through the NoLSAF platform. This policy applies exclusively to Property Owners who are registered and active on the platform.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.2 Cashless Payment Principle</strong><br />

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.3 Payment Flow</strong><br />
          As outlined in section 1.3.3 of our <Link href="/terms" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Terms of Service</Link>, all payments made by Users are directed to NoLSAF accounts first.

        <p>
          <strong>3.1 Account Information Accuracy</strong><br />
          Property Owners are responsible for maintaining accurate and up-to-date payment account information in their NoLSAF dashboard. This includes bank account details, mobile money numbers, or other payment method information required for disbursements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.1.1 Verification Requirements:</strong> All payment account information must be verified before disbursements can be processed. Property Owners must provide valid, active payment accounts that match their registered identity on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.1.2 Update Obligations:</strong> Property Owners must promptly update their payment information if their account details change, are closed, or become invalid. Failure to maintain accurate payment information may result in delayed or failed disbursements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.2 Tax and Legal Compliance</strong><br />
          Property Owners are solely responsible for complying with all applicable tax laws, regulations, and reporting requirements in their jurisdiction. NoLSAF may provide transaction records to assist with tax reporting, but Property Owners are responsible for calculating, reporting, and paying all applicable taxes on their earnings.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.2.2 Record Keeping:</strong> Property Owners are responsible for maintaining their own records of earnings and disbursements for tax and accounting purposes. NoLSAF provides transaction history through the platform, but Property Owners should maintain independent records.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.3 Service Delivery Obligations</strong><br />
          Property Owners must fulfill their service delivery obligations as outlined in the <Link href="/terms" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Terms of Service</Link> to be eligible for disbursements. Disbursements are contingent upon successful completion of services and User satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.3.1 Property Owner Responsibilities:</strong> Property Owners must provide accommodations as described in their listings, maintain property standards, and comply with all booking terms. Disbursements may be delayed or withheld if services are not delivered as agreed or if there are unresolved disputes with Users.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.4 Communication Responsibilities</strong><br />
          Property Owners are responsible for responding promptly to communications from NoLSAF regarding disbursements, account verification, or payment-related matters. Failure to respond may result in delayed disbursements.

        <p>
          <strong>3.5 Platform Compliance</strong><br />

        <p>
          <strong>4.1 Registration and Onboarding Requirements</strong><br />
          Property Owners are strongly advised and encouraged to provide all payment method information and complete verification during the initial registration and onboarding process when joining the NoLSAF platform. Completing payment method setup and verification during registration ensures timely disbursements once services begin and earnings are generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.1.1 Registration Payment Setup:</strong> During the registration process, Property Owners should provide their preferred payment method information, including all required account details, and initiate the verification process immediately upon account creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.1.2 Early Verification Benefits:</strong> Completing payment method verification during registration allows Property Owners to receive disbursements immediately upon earning their first payments, without delays associated with post-registration verification processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.1.3 Multiple Payment Methods:</strong> Property Owners may provide multiple payment method options during registration, though only one primary payment method will be active for disbursements at any given time. Having multiple verified payment methods provides flexibility and backup options.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.1.4 Registration Verification Process:</strong> The verification process during registration follows the same requirements outlined in section 4.4.1 (Verification Process), including OTP verification from NoLSAF and any additional verification steps required.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.1.5 Incomplete Registration Payment Setup:</strong> If payment method information is not provided or verified during registration, Property Owners must complete this process before they can receive any disbursements. Earnings will accumulate in their account until payment method verification is completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2 Digital Payment Methods</strong><br />
          All disbursements to Property Owners are processed exclusively through digital payment methods. NoLSAF supports the following digital payment methods for disbursements:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2.1 Mobile Money Services:</strong> M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Tigo Pesa, HaloPesa, and other supported mobile money platforms. Property Owners must provide valid, active mobile money numbers registered in their name.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2.2 Bank Transfers:</strong> Direct bank transfers to verified bank accounts. Property Owners must provide accurate bank account details including account number, bank name, branch, and account holder name matching their registered identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2.3 Payment Platform Accounts:</strong> PayPal, Stripe, or other supported payment platform accounts, where applicable and supported by NoLSAF.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.3 Payment Method Selection</strong><br />
          Property Owners must select and configure their preferred payment method through their NoLSAF dashboard. Only one primary payment method can be active at a time, though Property Owners may update their payment method as needed. Property Owners who completed payment method setup during registration can activate their verified payment method immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4 Verification Process:</strong> All payment methods must undergo verification before disbursements can be processed. Verification is mandatory and includes multiple security steps to ensure the security and accuracy of payment information. Property Owners who complete verification during registration will have their payment methods ready for immediate use once they begin earning.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.1 One-Time Password (OTP) Verification:</strong> NoLSAF requires OTP verification as part of the payment method verification process. Property Owners will receive a one-time password from NoLSAF via SMS or email to the registered contact information. This OTP must be entered within the specified time limit to complete the verification process. OTP verification is required both during registration and for any subsequent payment method changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.2 Additional Verification Methods:</strong> In addition to OTP verification, NoLSAF may require additional verification steps, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.2.1</strong> Providing additional documentation such as bank statements, mobile money account statements, or proof of account ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.2.2</strong> Completing identity verification to confirm that the payment account matches the registered Property Owner identity on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.2.3</strong> Verifying account details through test transactions or micro-deposits, where applicable and supported by the payment provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.2.4</strong> Providing additional contact information or emergency contact details for account recovery purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.3 Verification Timeline:</strong> Verification processes may take 1-5 business days to complete, depending on the payment method selected and the completeness of documentation provided. Property Owners will be notified of verification status through their dashboard and via email. Verification completed during registration may be processed more quickly as part of the onboarding workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.4 Verification Failure:</strong> If verification fails due to incorrect information, expired OTP, or incomplete documentation, Property Owners must restart the verification process. Multiple failed verification attempts may result in temporary restrictions on payment method changes or account activation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.5 Verification Requirements:</strong> All verification requirements must be completed before any disbursements can be processed to the payment method. Unverified payment methods will not receive disbursements, and earnings will remain in the Property Owner's account until verification is completed. Property Owners are strongly advised to complete verification during registration to avoid delays in receiving their first disbursements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.5 Payment Method Changes:</strong> Property Owners may change their payment method through their dashboard, but all changes must undergo the same verification process outlined in section 4.4 above, including OTP verification from NoLSAF.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.5.1 Change Verification Requirements:</strong> When changing a payment method, Property Owners must complete the full verification process, including OTP verification, before the new payment method can be activated for disbursements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.5.2 Timing of Changes:</strong> Changes made during an active payout period may delay disbursements until verification is completed. Property Owners are advised to update payment methods well in advance of expected payout dates to avoid delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.5.3 Previous Payment Method:</strong> The previous payment method will remain active for pending disbursements until the new payment method is fully verified and activated. Once the new payment method is verified, all future disbursements will be processed to the new method.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.5.4 Security Measures:</strong> Payment method changes are subject to additional security measures, including OTP verification, to prevent unauthorized changes and protect Property Owner accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.6 Payment Method Limitations</strong><br />
          Some payment methods may have limitations, including minimum disbursement amounts, maximum transaction limits, or geographic restrictions. Property Owners will be informed of any applicable limitations when selecting their payment method during registration or when updating payment methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.7 Failed Disbursements</strong><br />
          If a disbursement fails due to incorrect payment information, closed accounts, or other payment method issues, NoLSAF will attempt to notify the Property Owner. The Property Owner must update their payment information promptly and complete verification. Failed disbursements may incur additional processing fees as outlined in section 6 (Fees and Deductions).

        <p>
          <strong>5.5.1 Threshold Amounts:</strong> Minimum payout thresholds may vary by payment method and will be clearly communicated to Property Owners through their dashboard. Thresholds may be adjusted with advance notice as outlined in section 12 (Amendments to Disbursement Policy).

          <strong>6.1 Commission and Service Fees</strong><br />
          NoLSAF charges commissions and service fees on bookings, which are deducted from gross earnings before disbursement. The commission structure and rates are established in the agreement between NoLSAF and each Property Owner during the registration process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.1.1 Commission Agreement During Registration:</strong> During the registration process, NoLSAF and Property Owners will agree on the commission rates that will be added to the base price submitted by the Property Owner. This agreement establishes the pricing structure for listings, where the commission rate is incorporated into the final booking price paid by Users. Property Owners will receive disbursement of their base price under the circumstances and terms established in this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.1.2 Base Price Disbursement:</strong> Property Owners will receive disbursement of their agreed base price for completed bookings, subject to the terms and conditions outlined in this Disbursement Policy. The base price represents the amount agreed upon between NoLSAF and the Property Owner during registration, before the addition of commission rates. Disbursement of the base price is subject to: successful completion of the booking, verification of service delivery, resolution of any disputes, and compliance with all applicable policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.1.3 Commission Rates:</strong> Commission rates may vary based on property type, service category, volume, or special agreements established during registration.
