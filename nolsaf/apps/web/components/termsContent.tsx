          a. Payment Requirements; depending on the nature of the service selected, Users may be required to provide full payment upfront
          or submit a non-refundable deposit at the time of booking to secure their reservation. The specific payment terms shall be
          clearly articulated at the point of sale.<br />
          b. Authorized Payment Methods; Only those payment methods expressly accepted by NoLSAF shall be utilized for transactions.

          All payments made by Users shall be directed to NoLSAF accounts. Subsequently, NoLSAF shall disburse the appropriate amounts to
          the respective Owners and Drivers in accordance with established agreements and payout schedules (this is according to
          <Link href="/disbursement-policy" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Disbursement Policy</Link>). This ensures that both the Owners and Drivers receive timely compensation for their services while
          maintaining financial transparency.<br />
          1.3.4 Cash Payment options, NoLSAF agrees to process only digital payments, except in instances where individuals submit a
          non-refundable deposit at the time of booking to secure their reservation. In such cases, the individual shall have the option

          1.3.5 Booking Validity period, a booking shall remain valid for a period of 24 hours from the time of reservation if only a
          non-refundable deposit is paid. If the remaining balance is not settled within this timeframe, the booking may be subject to
          cancellation, and the property may become available for other Users.<br />
          1.3.6 No Room Assurance, users who opt for the non-refundable deposit payment method shall not be guaranteed the specific room
          selected if the remaining payment is not completed within the agreed framework. This lack of payment assurance may result in
          the reallocation of the User to an alternative available room that fits the original booking criteria.<br />
          1.3.7 Guaranteed Rate, the rates and availability of properties are subject to change. If the remaining payment is not made
          within the specified timeframes, Users may face an adjustment in pricing or availability upon rebooking, reflecting current
          rates and conditions.<br />
          1.3.8 Group Bookings exception, the reallocation of rooms shall not apply to reservations made for group stays. Users who book
          accommodations for a group shall have their booked rooms secured as specified in their reservation, provided that all payment
          terms are adhered to. If the remaining balance is not paid in accordance with the terms, the entire group booking may be
          subject to cancellation.<br />
          1.3.9 Change of Check-In Date, in order for a Group Stay reservation not to fall into complete cancellation, Users must notify
          the Owner within 24 hours of the scheduled check-in time to express their intention to change their check-in date. Such changes
          will be subject to approval and become valid under certain circumstances, including availability and any applicable terms
          outlined in the property’s policies.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1.4 Pricing and Charges</strong><br />
          All charges associated with bookings will be quoted based on the original price. This practice ensures transparency and enables
          Users to have a clear understanding of the financial obligations involved in their reservations. The breakdown of costs will
          include the following key components;<br />
          1.4.1 Original Price Quotation, each property listing will specify the original price, serving as the baseline for all financial
          transactions. This price reflects the standard rate prior to any discounts, promotions, or additional fees, thereby providing

          1.4.2 Detailed Cost Breakdown, users/traveller/customer will receive a comprehensive breakdown of all applicable charges at the
          time of booking. This breakdown will encompass, the original rate for the accommodation or service.<br />

          after the User has arrived at their booked area. Any additional fees such as cleaning fees or service charges will be managed
          solely by the property Owner. Users should understand that NoLSAF solely facilitates the booking process and any payments
          related to additional services or fees occurring after the initial transaction fall under the Owner’s management.<br />
          1.4.4 Engagement in Booking Packages, the only packages that NoLSAF will engage with are those added during the booking process,
          particularly for end-to-end services, including transportation. Users may optionally include transport packages in their
          bookings, whether they require immediate scheduling or advance planning. Additionally, any inclusive services offered alongside
          the booking must be agreed upon at the time of reservation.<br />
          1.4.5 Communication of Discounts and Surcharges, any promotional discounts or time sensitive offers will be clearly communicated,
          allowing Users to take advantage of cost-saving opportunities while booking. Conversely, any surcharges incurred such as fees
          for additional services or late check-ins will also be communicated clearly to prevent unforeseen financial implications.

          1.5.1 Local Currency Quotation, prices for accommodations, services, and any associated fees will be presented in the local
          currency relevant to the property’s location. This practice helps Users avoid confusion related to currency conversions and

          1.5.2 Exchange Rates, users shall be informed of the applicable exchange rates at the time of booking if they are transacting in
          a currency different from the local currency. NoLSAF will strive to provide the most accurate and competitive rates available;
          however, Users are encouraged to consult their financial institutions for the most current rates prior to completing
          transactions.<br />
          1.5.3 Transaction Fees, any potential transaction fees related to currency conversion or international payments may apply
          depending on the payment method utilized. Users will be made aware of these fees during the booking process, ensuring they can
          account for any additional costs that may arise from their payment selections.<br />
          1.5.4 Responsibility for Currency Conversion, Users are responsible for any fees associated with converting funds to the required
          local currency. This includes any bank charges or processing fees incurred as a result of using international credit/debit
          cards or mobile payment platforms.<br />
          1.5.5 Payment Processing Compliance, all currency transactions processed through the NoLSAF platform will comply with applicable
