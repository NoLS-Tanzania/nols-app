          The Cancellation Policy for NoLSAF varies based on the type of service booked. Users are encouraged to review the specific cancellation terms provided at the time of booking to ensure understanding of applicable conditions. This policy applies to all reservations made through the NoLSAF platform, including individual bookings and group stays.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.1 Special Considerations:</strong> Group stays (bookings for multiple guests, multiple rooms, or special arrangements) are subject to additional cancellation terms as outlined in section 4 (Group Stay Cancellations). Users booking group stays should carefully review section 4 in addition to the general cancellation policy.

        <p>
          By making a reservation through NoLSAF, Users acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Cancellation Policy.

          <strong>2.1 Free Cancellation Period</strong><br />
          Users may cancel their bookings free of charge within 24 hours of making the reservation, provided the cancellation occurs at least 72 hours before the scheduled check-in time. This grace period allows Users to reconsider their booking without financial penalty, subject to the 72-hour advance notice requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2.2 Partial Refunds</strong><br />
          Cancellations made after the free cancellation period, but at least 4 days (96 hours) before the scheduled check-in time, may be eligible for a 50% refund of the total amount paid.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2.3 Non-Refundable Bookings</strong><br />
          Some promotional rates, special offers, last-minute bookings, or properties with specific terms may be designated as non-refundable.

Non-refundable bookings are not eligible for any refund, regardless of cancellation timing or circumstances.

        <p>
          <strong>3.1 General Policy</strong><br />
          Cancellations after check-in are generally not eligible for refunds. Once a User has checked in to their booked accommodation, the booking is considered active, and no refunds will be offered for unused nights or services after the booking has commenced. This policy applies regardless of the reason for early departure, unless exceptional circumstances apply as outlined below. Users should understand that early departure does not automatically qualify for any refund, and all requests will be subject to strict evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.2 Exceptional Circumstances</strong><br />
          Refunds or modifications after check-in are extremely rare and will only be considered in cases of genuine, verifiable emergencies that are completely beyond the User&apos;s control and prevent the User from continuing their stay. NoLSAF maintains strict criteria for exceptional circumstances, and the burden of proof rests entirely with the User. All requests must meet the specific requirements outlined in the subsections below, and even if all requirements are met, NoLSAF reserves the absolute right to deny any refund request.

    content: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          <strong>4.1 General Policy for Group Stays</strong><br />
          Group stays are defined as bookings made for multiple guests, typically involving multiple rooms or accommodations, and may include special arrangements, group rates, or customized services. Cancellation policies for group stays differ from individual bookings due to the complexity and scale of these reservations. This section applies specifically to group stay bookings and supplements the general cancellation policy outlined in sections 2 and 3 above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2 Group Stay Cancellation Terms</strong><br />
          Group stay cancellations are subject to stricter terms than individual bookings due to the impact on property owners and the difficulty of rebooking multiple accommodations. The specific cancellation terms for each group stay booking will be clearly communicated at the time of booking and may vary based on the property, group size, booking dates, and special arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2.1 Free Cancellation Period for Group Stays:</strong> Group stays may have a reduced or eliminated free cancellation period compared to individual bookings. The free cancellation period, if applicable, will be specified in the booking confirmation and may require cancellation 14 days or more before the scheduled check-in date.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2.2 Partial Cancellations:</strong> Partial cancellations (reducing the number of rooms or guests) are subject to availability and property owner approval. Partial cancellations may result in rate adjustments, loss of group discounts, or additional fees. Users must contact NoLSAF customer support at <a href="mailto:info@nolsaf.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">info@nolsaf.com</a> or through the <Link href="/help" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">support page</Link> to request partial cancellations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2.3 Refund Eligibility for Group Stays:</strong> Refunds for group stay cancellations are calculated based on the cancellation timeline and the specific terms agreed upon at booking. Generally, cancellations made more than 30 days before check-in may be eligible for partial refunds, while cancellations made within 30 days of check-in may be non-refundable or subject to significant penalties.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2.4 Non-Refundable Deposits:</strong> Group stays often require non-refundable deposits that are separate from the general cancellation policy. These deposits are typically required to secure the booking and will not be refunded regardless of cancellation timing, unless otherwise specified in the booking agreement.

          <strong>4.3 Group Stay Modifications</strong><br />
          Modifications to group stay bookings, including changes to dates, number of guests, or accommodations, require advance notice and are subject to availability and property owner approval. Significant modifications may be treated as cancellations and rebookings, subject to the cancellation terms outlined in section 4.2 above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.3.1 Date Changes:</strong> Date changes for group stays may be permitted if requested at least 60 days before the original check-in date, subject to property availability and owner approval. Date changes may incur additional fees or rate adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.3.2 Guest Count Changes:</strong> Reducing the number of guests may result in loss of group discounts, rate adjustments, or cancellation of unused accommodations. Increasing the number of guests is subject to property capacity and availability, and may require additional payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.3.3 Accommodation Changes:</strong> Changing the type or number of accommodations in a group stay booking may be treated as a cancellation and rebooking, subject to applicable cancellation terms and new booking rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4 Group Stay Cancellation After Check-In</strong><br />
          The policies outlined in section 3 (After Check-In) apply to group stays, with additional considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.1 Early Departure:</strong> If some members of a group depart early, no refunds will be provided for unused accommodations or nights, unless the entire group departs and exceptional circumstances apply as defined in section 3.2.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.2 Partial Group Departure:</strong> Individual members of a group may depart early without affecting the booking for remaining group members. No refunds will be provided for departing members&apos; unused accommodations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4.3 Exceptional Circumstances:</strong> The exceptional circumstances outlined in section 3.2 apply to group stays, but the burden of proof and documentation requirements may be more stringent due to the impact on multiple accommodations and the property owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.5 Group Stay No-Show Policy</strong><br />
          The no-show policy outlined in section 5 below applies to group stays. If the entire group fails to check in, the full booking amount will be charged with no refunds. If only some group members fail to check in, charges will apply to the no-show members&rsquo; accommodations only, while the remaining group members&lsquo; booking will proceed as scheduled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.6 Group Stay Communication Requirements</strong><br />
          Due to the complexity of group stays, all cancellation and modification requests must be submitted in writing through the NoLSAF platform or via email to <a href="mailto:info@nolsaf.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">info@nolsaf.com</a>. Verbal requests will not be accepted for group stay cancellations or modifications. Users should allow additional processing time for group stay cancellation requests, as these require coordination with property owners and may take 5-7 business days to process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.7 Group Stay Special Arrangements</strong><br />
          Group stays may include special arrangements such as catering, event spaces, transportation, or other services. Cancellation of these special arrangements is subject to separate terms and may be non-refundable regardless of accommodation cancellation status. Users should review the terms for each special arrangement at the time of booking.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.8 Coordination with Property Owners</strong><br />
          Group stay cancellations and modifications require coordination with property owners, as outlined in section 3.2.9 (Property Owner Consultation and Analysis). Property owners have significant discretion regarding group stay cancellations due to the impact on their operations and the difficulty of rebooking multiple accommodations on short notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.9 Group Stay Refund Processing</strong><br />
          Refunds for group stays, when applicable, will be processed according to the timeline outlined in section 7 (Refund Processing). However, group stay refunds may require additional processing time (up to 14 business days) due to the complexity of calculating refunds for multiple accommodations and coordinating with property owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.10 Group Stay Dispute Resolution</strong><br />
          Disputes regarding group stay cancellations follow the dispute resolution process outlined in section 10 (Dispute Resolution). However, group stay disputes may require additional documentation and coordination time due to the complexity of these bookings.

        <p>
          <strong>5.1 Definition</strong><br />
          A &quot;No-Show&quot; occurs when a User fails to arrive at the booked accommodation on the scheduled check-in date without prior notification or cancellation. This includes situations where the User does not check in by the property&apos;s specified check-in deadline and has not communicated their delay or cancellation to NoLSAF or the property owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5.2 Consequences</strong><br />
          Users who do not cancel their reservation and fail to show up for their booking will be charged the full amount of their booking. No refunds will be provided for no-show bookings, regardless of the reason for the absence. The property owner reserves the right to release the accommodation for other bookings after the no-show period has elapsed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5.3 Late Arrivals</strong><br />
          If a User anticipates arriving late but still intends to check in, they must contact the property owner or NoLSAF customer support in advance to arrange for late check-in. Failure to communicate may result in the booking being treated as a no-show.

          <strong>6.1 Changes to Reservations</strong><br />
          Users wishing to modify their bookings, including changing dates, number of guests, or accommodation type, must contact NoLSAF customer support through the platform&apos;s messaging system, email at <a href="mailto:info@nolsaf.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">info@nolsaf.com</a>, or the <Link href="/help" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">dedicated support page</Link>. All modification requests are subject to availability at the property and may incur additional fees, price differences, or administrative charges. NoLSAF and property owners reserve the right to approve or deny modification requests based on availability and property policies. For group stays, refer to section 4.3 (Group Stay Modifications) for specific modification terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.2 Cancellation Required for Rescheduling</strong><br />
          If the requested modification affects the original booking significantly (such as changing dates that fall outside the property&apos;s availability window, or changing to a different property), a cancellation of the original reservation may be required, subject to the same cancellation terms and refund policies outlined in section 2 (Before Check-In) of this policy. For group stays, refer to section 4.3 (Group Stay Modifications). In such cases, Users will need to make a new booking, and the original booking will be processed according to the applicable cancellation policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.3 Modification Fees</strong><br />
          Some modifications may be subject to administrative fees or price adjustments. Users will be informed of any additional charges before modifications are confirmed. If a modification results in a lower total price, the difference will be refunded according to the refund policy outlined in section 8 (Refund Processing). If the modification results in a higher total price, the User will be required to pay the difference before the modification is finalized.

However, all cancellation requests should be processed through NoLSAF&apos;s official channels to ensure proper documentation and refund processing.

          Eligible refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 5-10 business days after the cancellation is confirmed. The actual time for funds to appear in the User&apos;s account may vary depending on the payment provider, including M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Tigo Pesa, or credit card issuers. Users should contact their payment provider if refunds are not received within the expected timeframe. For group stays, refer to section 4.9 (Group Stay Refund Processing) for extended processing timelines.

          <strong>8.2 Refund Amount</strong><br />

          <strong>8.3 Currency and Exchange Rates</strong><br />

          In rare circumstances, property owners may need to cancel a confirmed booking due to unforeseen circumstances, including property damage, maintenance issues, or double bookings. In such cases, NoLSAF will notify the User immediately and work to find alternative accommodation of similar or better quality at no additional cost to the User. If no suitable alternative is available, Users will receive a full refund of all amounts paid. For group stays, this process may require additional coordination as outlined in section 4.8 (Coordination with Property Owners).

          <strong>9.2 Compensation</strong><br />
